# Mistakes and Memories

Visual novel adventure game with three.js scenes. Currently in development.

## Artistic description

This is a visual novel adventure game that is currently in development and uses queer perspectives on weaponization. While cyborgs have been an integral part of queer utopias, robots, drones, and other autonomous bodies are being developed in close connection with the warfare industry. This project questions the ability to adopt technologies as a part of queer utopias and the queer experience of killing in war that military teleoperations provide.
